# Project Background

Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the modern workplace, offering both opportunities and challenges. As businesses integrate AI technologies to streamline operations and gain a competitive edge, the impact on employees is profound. From the automation of routine tasks to the creation of entirely new roles, AI is fundamentally altering the nature of work. Understanding these implications is crucial for businesses and workers alike as they navigate this transformative era.

AI's influence on the workforce is a subject of both intrigue and apprehension. This project throughly analyzes and synthesizes this data in order to offer a comprehensive understanding of AI's multifaceted impact on various aspects of employment, including industries, job roles, human tasks, and workload distribution. 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas: 

- **Job Threat Index**: A comprehensive analysis of top job titles, examining the transformative effects of AI on their roles and responsibilities.
- **Domain Comparison**: A critical analysis of domains experiencing the most profound impact from AI technologies.
- **AI Impact**: An assessment of the impact of AI on various job titles and roles.
- **AI Models**: Evaluation of patterns in AI models.

 Prior to beginning the analysis, a variety of checks were conducted for quality control and familiarization with the dataset. 

 ## Data Information/Features

- **Job titles**: Different job titles or roles.

- **AI Impact**: The percentage of tasks in a particular job role that can be replaced by AI.

- **Tasks**: Number of tasks associated with each job title.

- **AI models**: The number of AI models associated with each job title. This could represent the number of AI models that could potentially replace or assist with the tasks of that job title.

- **AI Workload Ratio**: A ratio representing the portion of workload that can be replaced by AI for each job title.
Domain: The domain or sector to which each job title belongs.


 # Executive Summary 
 
 ### Overview of Findings

Artificial intelligence (AI) presents both opportunities and challenges for the labor market. While AI can automate tasks, enhance productivity, and create new jobs, it also raises concerns about job displacement and changes in skill requirements. Our analysis reveals that AI's average impact on jobs is significant, with approximately 30% of roles potentially affected. Additionally, AI could automate up to 20% of the workload within many job titles. Based on these metrics, we estimate that AI could impact around 4,706 jobs across 10 domains.

### Job Threat Index (No. of Jobs by AI Impact)

- AI is a disruptive force in the global economy that could potentially affect 20% of jobs. This indicates that a significant number of job roles will likely experience a moderate level of AI influence.

- While AI can automate tasks and improve efficiency, it is unlikely to completely replace human involvement in most job roles. The significant drop in frequency beyond 40% suggests that only a small number of roles are well-suited for extensive AI integration, where AI could handle a major portion of tasks without significant human intervention.

### Distribution of Jobs by Domain and 

- The analysis identified distinct job title counts for various domains, revealing a historical trend of job growth in six sectors that accrued 471 job titles each. Construction, Sales and Marketing, Hospitality, and Law Enforcement encompassed 470 job titles, reflecting a more stable job market.

### AI Impact by Domain (Sectors)
  
- The findings suggest that domains like Communication & PR, Data & IT, Leadership & Strategy, and Administrative & Clerical are approaching full automation through AI, with job titles and roles within these sectors being particularly susceptible.
  
- Additionally, within these sectors, specific job roles are showing job impact scores exceeding 10%, suggesting a high likelihood of future automation.

- Even though some of these domains may fall below the midpoint, it's crucial not to underestimate their importance. These domains often encompass critical roles within any organization. This emphasizes the need for a careful evaluation and proactive approach to address the potential implications of AI integrations across various job roles and organizations

### Distribution of tasks 

- **Domain**: Although tasks were generally distributed evenly across domains, 'Data & IT' and 'Construction' stood out with exceptionally high workloads approaching 1400 tasks each.

- **Job Titles**: Among job titles, Instructional Designer, Senior Technical Writer, Program Administrator, Program Associate, Director, and Manager emerged as leaders in task completion, often surpassing 1300 tasks. This highlights how the rapid adoption of AI can lead to increased efficiency and the creation of new roles, but also poses risks like job displacement and the need for evolving skill sets.

### Average of AI Models by domain

The analysis reveals a significant disparity in the average number of AI models deployed across domains. Hospitality, Sales and Marketing, and Construction stand out with 1869.45, 1855.70, and 1849.41 AI models, respectively, demonstrating a higher level of AI integration and potential for improved accuracy and reliability. In contrast, Medical and Healthcare lags behind with 1760.85 AI models, suggesting a lower level of AI adoption. These trends may be attributed to factors such as industry maturity, technological readiness, and regulatory environments.
